# TASTickrateChanger
Original by [Guichaguri](https://github.com/Guichaguri/TickrateChanger)  
Let's you change the server/client tickrate    
Fixed issues and hooked up things that didn't get affected by the tickrate:  
 - Enchanting Glimmer Animation  
 - Achievement/Recipe/System Message (also called Toasts) Animation
 - Fade out of Subtitles
 - Scroll wheel works in tickrates below 5  
 
Changed ASM method from coremod to [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin)
